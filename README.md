# True_False_Positives
Allows someone to input a directory with text files including true positives (column must be labeled tp) and false positives
(must be labeled fp) and outputs one pdf that displays separate scatterplots for each file. Rectangles show the minimum-median
and median-maximum of all true and false positives.
